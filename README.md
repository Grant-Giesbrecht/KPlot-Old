# KPlot
Plotting Library for C++ and Java

A major handicap of C++ and Java is that there is no easy way to quickly throw your data on screen as plots. This has two
horrifing effects:
  1. Reduce the visibility of data produced with these languages!
    OR
  2. Push people away from these wonderful languages!
This is where KPlot comes in - KPlot allows quick, easy, and beautiful plots to be made in C++ and Java! This makes KPlot
the next installment in the plan to make Octave/MATLAB nothing more than a forgotten relic of the past.
